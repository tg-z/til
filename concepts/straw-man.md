## Expansion

Subtly expanding the opponents argument to refute only the part that you have changed.A: Canadians like hockey.B: Not all Canadians like hockey, Canadians are individuals who are all unique people. Don't treat them as if they can't think for themselves. Some Canadians intensely dislike hockey. You don't speak for all Canadians, you aren't even Canadian yourself.This example contains multiple straw man arguments. Person A did not claim that _all_ Canadians like hockey or that she represents all Canadians or that Canadians can't think for themselves or that she herself is Canadian.

## Misrepresentation

## Checkers Speech

The checkers speech was an address made by Richard Nixon on September 23, 1952. At the time, there were accusations that he had misused funds related to his political campaign. Nixon stated that there was one gift he had received that he would not return: a dog named Checkers that was beloved by his children. The speech was emotional and personal and highly successful in changing public opinion. It is considered an example of a straw man argument because no one was accusing Nixon of improprieties related to the dog.

### Straw Man vs Steelmanning

A straw man seeks to misrepresent the opponent's argument to make it appear weak or absurd. Steelmanning is the opposite approach that strengthens the opponent's position before refuting it. For example:A: Computers are stupid and will never be as smart as people.B: So you're saying there are certain aspects of human intelligence that computers can not match. Well, that is certainly true but ...Steelmanning is characteristic of an [objective](https://simplicable.com/new/objectivity) argument that seeks the truth over an easy but deceptive "win."

### Etymology

The term straw man first appears in 1585-95 to refer to something that is insubstantial. This is considered an [analogy](https://simplicable.com/new/analogy) to a scarecrow stuffed with straw that is designed to look like a man without the substantial elements of a human such as a brain. An 1897 definition of "man of straw" reads “The figure of a man formed of an old suit of clothes stuffed with straw; hence, the mere resemblance of a man; one of no substance or means; an imaginary person.”
